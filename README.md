Hello this is a react native Wallet app that is able to store cards and keys
with RFID and NFC tags.

NOTE - payment processing system is not set up example - stripe API;

****you will have to process payments on your own;

Also for security reasons we didn't implement the parser for the NFC and card read because it can be used for other purposes.

this app is built upon MERN Stack

    Express , MongoDB, React Native and NodeJS

Please make sure to install dependencies and use correct configration for android and ios when it comes to Permissions

Thanks;
